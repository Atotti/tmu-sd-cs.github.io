          <p class="mt20 mt05sp">Due to the advancement of computers and the rise of big data, research
            and development in the field of artificial intelligence are attracting
            global attention. Natural language processing, or computational
            linguistics, is a research field that uses computers to understand and
            generate human language. Words are represented mathematically and
            processed by computer programs. Natural language processing provides
            fundamental theories and technologies for various applications,
            including search engines, machine translation, dialogue systems,
            automatic summarization, and predictive text. Let's study cutting-edge
            artificial intelligence in our university.</p>

      <h3>Prospective Undergraduate Students</h3>
      <p>Natural language processing uses computers to analyze human language.
        It is an essential part of the information system you use every day,
        including predictive text, web search engines, and recommendation
        systems. It is one of the everyday technologies that we do not even realize the importance because it is too natural, but we will be in
        trouble if it is not there.</p>
      <p>Many of the students in our laboratory are science and engineering
        majors because they use mathematics to understand language, but there
        are also people from various humanities and social sciences majors
        such as linguistics, education, law, and economics. Natural language
        processing is an interdisciplinary field. Figure 1 shows a large-scale
        incorrect example search engine developed in our laboratory for
        Japanese language learners. It is implemented by a student from the
        department of foreign languages. Also, 30% of the graduate students
        have work experience and 30% of the PhD students are international
        students in our laboratory.</p>

      <h3>Prospective PhD Students</h3>
      <p>In the field of natural language processing, the concept of deep
        learning has emerged since 2012, surpassing the performance of
        conventional methods in a wide range of applications, including
        machine translation. One of the biggest benefits of deep learning in
        natural language processing is a task called language generation, in
        which the output is text. Besides machine translation, many language
        generation tasks witness dramatic improvements including document
        summarization, dialogue systems, and image caption generation. In the
        past, it was difficult to obtain fluent output with statistical
        methods, but by using deep learning, fluent text can be obtained, and
        language processing is attracting attention.</p>
      <p>In addition to mathematical formulation and programming frameworks,
        the success of deep learning is supported by large-scale high-quality
        data and appropriate evaluation metrics. Our research group focuses on
        deep learning techniques that can be applied even in the absence of
        large-scale data, on the construction of high-quality language
        resources that can be used widely in addition to deep learning, and on
        quantitative evaluation measures for language generation. Figure 2
        shows a neural machine translation system for web texts developed in
        our laboratory. As one of the few universities in Japan that has a
        machine translation research group, we regularly participate in
        machine translation shared tasks at international conferences and
        workshops.</p>

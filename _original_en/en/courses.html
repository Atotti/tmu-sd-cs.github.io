      <h2 class="mt0">Undergraduate</h2>
      <p>During the 1st and 2nd years, students will acquire  sufficient knowledge to interact with society by studying a wide range of  liberal arts at the Minami-Osawa Campus. Students develop the basic skills  necessary to acquire specialized knowledge through basic science subjects. In  the introductory courses starting in their first year, students will learn the  latest technologies, and in the second and subsequent years, they will take  three specialized subject groups (i.e., basic theory, architecture, and  content). In addition to mastering programming skills, we will also focus on  data analysis and content processing exercises.</p>
      <p>From 3rd year onward, they will move to Hino Campus  and continue studying their Â specialized  subjects. A student can develop his or her own expertise while learning these  three subject groups in a well-balanced manner. In the experiments, along with  advanced programming technology, data analysis and/or content processing,  problem-solving, and presentation abilities will also be nurtured. In the 4th  year, the students will take special studies (graduation research) under a supervisor.  They will receive detailed guidance and gain experience in cutting-edge  information technology research with one faculty member for every four  students. They will develop problem-finding, problem-solving, discussion, and presentation skills.</p>

  <h2 class="mt0">Undergraduate Curriculum</h2>
  <p>&emsp;In the first and second years, students study at the Minami-Osawa Campus, where they acquire a broad foundation of knowledge through liberal arts courses to develop the necessary qualities for engaging with society. They also build the fundamental skills needed for specialized knowledge through basic science courses and departmental foundation courses. Starting from the first year, students learn cutting-edge technologies through introductory domain courses, and from the second year onwards, they take three groups of specialized departmental courses (Theoretical Foundations, Architecture, and Content). In addition to programming skills, emphasis is also placed on practical training in data analysis and content processing.</p>
  <p>&emsp;From the third year onwards, students move to the Hino Campus and continue their studies in the specialized departmental courses. While studying these three course groups in a balanced manner, students can also develop their own specializations. In laboratory work, students develop not only advanced programming skills and data analysis/content processing abilities but also problem-solving and presentation skills. In the fourth year, students undertake special research (graduation research) under the guidance of a supervisor. With detailed guidance in small research groups of about four students per faculty member, students experience cutting-edge information technology research, which helps them develop skills in problem identification, problem-solving, discussion, and presentation.</p>

  <ul>
    <li> <b>Q: What is the difference between the Department of Computer Science and the Department of Electronic Information Systems?</b>
      <p>
        <b>A:</b> Roughly speaking, the Department of Computer Science specializes in software<a href="#exp">*</a>, while the Department of Electronic Information Systems provides a balanced education in both software and hardware. Courses unique to the Department of Computer Science include "Introduction to Big Data Mining," "Introduction to Artificial Intelligence and Natural Language Processing," "Introduction to Social Multimedia," "Artificial Intelligence," "Database," "Usability Engineering," "Machine Learning," "HCI," "Intelligent Agents," "Data Mining," "Acoustic and Speech Signal Processing," "Kansei Engineering," "Virtual Reality," "Applied Mathematics for Computer Science," "Network Science," "Information Visualization," and "Natural Language Processing."

    <li>
      <b>Q: Are there any qualifications that can be obtained besides a degree?</b>
      <p> <b>A:</b> By completing the required credits, you can obtain a teaching license for the high school subject "Information." You can also apply for teaching licenses in other subjects such as "Mathematics" and "English" by earning the necessary credits at the Minami-Osawa Campus. The Department of Computer Science is the only department in the Faculty of Systems Design where teaching licenses can be obtained (students who entered through the Department of Electronic Information Systems cannot apply for a license even if they take courses related to teaching).</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <b>Q: What is the International Minor Program?</b>
      <p>
        <b>A:</b> This is a program available to students who entered through the Global Human Resource Development Admission (AO entrance examination). By studying abroad for at least one semester and earning the required credits for the minor, students can receive a minor completion certification when they complete their major. Students who entered through other admission methods cannot enroll in this program. Also, even if students who entered through the Global Human Resource Development Admission cannot complete the International Minor Program, it will not affect the completion of their major.

    <li>
      <b>Q: What are the career paths after graduation?</b>
      <p>
        <b>A:</b> About 80% of undergraduate students wish to proceed to graduate school. For those who wish to enter graduate school, there is a written examination exemption (recommendation admission) system. By spending a total of six years at our university, combining undergraduate and master's studies, students can acquire advanced research and development skills. After completing graduate school (master's program), graduates work in various jobs, primarily as software engineers.

    <li>
      <b>Q: Can I visit the laboratories?</b>
      <p>
        <b>A:</b> Every year, we hold an Open Campus at the Hino Campus in July and a forum called the Systems Design Forum in October, where you can visit many laboratories. If there are specific laboratories you would like to visit, please feel free to contact them individually.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <b>Q: Is the campus not at the Minami-Osawa Campus?</b>
      <p>
        <b>A:</b> All specialized courses from the third year of undergraduate studies through graduate school are held at the Hino Campus. All student laboratories are also located in Hino, so students only commute to the Minami-Osawa Campus for the first two years of undergraduate studies. Additionally, second-year undergraduate students have a "Hino Day" where they attend classes at the Hino Campus once a week.

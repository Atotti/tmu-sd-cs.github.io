<section>
  <p>&emsp;In modern society, information technology is used in all fields around the world, causing changes that are referred to as the fourth "industrial revolution" in history. Until the mid-19th century, civil engineering was the central field, but by the early 20th century, mechanical engineering had developed, and during World War I, electrical engineering and chemical engineering expanded their roles, followed by nuclear engineering during World War II. As we entered the 21st century, with the expansion of the Internet, the advancement of computers, the rapid development of artificial intelligence, multimedia, and social media, the era of big data has arrived, all of which can be considered achievements of information technology. While new technologies emerge day by day around the world, social risk factors tend to diversify. In the face of such unknown situations, there is an urgent need to train individuals who can make accurate decisions with a view to the future by utilizing information technology and who can play an active role globally. The Department of Computer Science aims to nurture software engineers who can flexibly adapt to such rapidly changing times, are proficient in advanced information technology, and can play an active role internationally.</p>

description: With the development of information networks, phenomena on the Internet have come to have a significant impact on real-world social activities. In particular, destructive dynamics such as online flaming not only adversely affect some victims but also pose a risk of causing widespread social losses. In our laboratory's latest research themes, we are working on understanding the causes of online flaming from an engineering perspective and realizing its suppression, where a world naturally emerges in which information network engineering and quantum theory are integrated.
